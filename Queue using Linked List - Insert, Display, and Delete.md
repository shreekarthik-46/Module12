# 12)a) Queue using Linked List - Insert, Display, and Delete

##  Aim

To write a Python program that:
- Inserts elements into a queue.
- Displays all inserted elements.
- Deletes the first element.
- Displays the updated queue after deletion.



##  Algorithm

1. **Create a Queue**:
   - Initialize an empty list named `queue`.

2. **Insert Elements**:
   - Use the `append()` method to insert elements `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'` into the queue.

3. **Display Initial Queue**:
   - Print the message `"Queue after elements are inserted:"` followed by the queue contents.

4. **Delete First Element**:
   - Use `pop(0)` to remove the first inserted element (FIFO - First In First Out).
   - Print the message `"Deleting the first element inserted:"` and the element removed.

5. **Display Updated Queue**:
   - Print the message `"Queue after the first element is deleted:"` followed by the updated queue contents.



## Program
```
queue = []
queue.append('a')
queue.append('b')
queue.append('c')
print('Queue after elements are inserted:')
print(queue)
print('Deleting the first element inserted:')
print(queue.pop(0))
print('Queue after the first elements is deleted:')
print(queue)
```




## Output
![queue-insert](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a9959a1-4e9a-4450-9ab5-1fae621aba11)

## Result
Thus a Python program that:
Inserts elements into a queue.
 Displays all inserted elements.
 Deletes the first element.
 Displays the updated queue after deletion is craeted.
